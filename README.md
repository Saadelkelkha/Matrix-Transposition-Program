# Matrix-Transposition-Program
This Program allows users to input a 5x5 matrix and then computes its transpose. The program takes user input for a 5x5 matrix, and after processing, it transposes the matrix by swapping elements along its main diagonal. Finally, it displays the transposed matrix as the output.
